    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend 
        of small-curd tofu. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad 
        and crusty garlic bread.
